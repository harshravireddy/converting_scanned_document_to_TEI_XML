This research addresses the crucial task of information retrieval from
historical documents, specifically those from the 18th and 19th centuries.
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology serves as a foundation
for this process, enabling the conversion of scanned documents into
machine-readable text format. A prominent OCR solution, Tesseract, was
employed in this study due to its capability of recognizing a vast array
of languages. This facilitated the extraction of valuable information and
metadata from the digitized historical materials. Furthermore, standardized
OCR-D processors were utilized to convert the raw data from its
original PDF format into a structured TEI XML format. This transformation
ensures the confidentiality and controlled access of the historical
data for future research endeavors and analytical purposes. The implemented
methodology offers a systematic approach to information gathering
and retrieval from historical documents. This approach aligns with
the broader efforts of digitalization and archival preservation, fostering
continued exploration and understanding of historical records.
